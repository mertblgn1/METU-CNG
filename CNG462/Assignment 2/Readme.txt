This game is a two-player game where players take turns removing squares from a chocolate bar grid. The game continues until a player eats the poisonous square, and the player who eats the top left square (poisonous square) loses. This program is implemented with two game modes: Human vs Human and AI vs Human. In the AI vs Human mode, the AI player uses the minimax algorithm to make optimal moves.
